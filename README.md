# rexupdate
My stab at a simple application updater.

####Intended supported scenarios.
* Use to check for updates and present information to user (information only, no auto-download or auto-update). DONE.
* Check for update and trigger external agent to download and initiate update on process exit. IN PROGRESS.
* Host process can check for updates and initialise the update themselves. IN PROGRESS.

####TODO
* Demo update server to replace current Linqpad script, most likely using Nancy.
